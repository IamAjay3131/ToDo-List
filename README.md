Project Description:
ToDo_list is a React with TypeScript-based application that allows users to manage daily tasks effectively.

Users can:

Add new to-do items with a name, priority level (High, Medium, or Low), and a due date.

Edit existing to-do items, allowing updates to task details as needed.

Filter tasks by priority to easily view High, Medium, or Low priority items.

Mark tasks as done/undone using a checkbox.

Delete individual to-do items if no longer needed.

Delete the entire list at once.

The app generates dynamic IDs for each to-do.

Data is persisted using the browser's Local Storage, ensuring tasks remain even after a page refresh or browser close.
